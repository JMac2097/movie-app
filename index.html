TODOs: Account has been setup in TMDB for an API key. The key is currently set for localhost use only, so if you plan to publish this, you will need to generate a new API key for that, because you have to register the URL.

A genre search might be good.
A placeholder image to reduce down the CLS when new results are loaded.
A better layout for the main page, maybe a film chart if you can get one
or popular by genre.
A feeling lucky punk addition that will return a random film based on pre-entered criteria.

We need a page for no results returned
The styling of the reset search button needs improving.
